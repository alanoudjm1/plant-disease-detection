# Plant Disease Detection and Classification

This project applies multiple deep learning architectures to classify plant diseases using the PlantVillage dataset. The models were trained, evaluated, and compared using performance metrics, learning curves, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an accurate and efficient system capable of identifying plant diseases from leaf images. The system includes a web application that allows users to upload an image and receive predictions from two models:
- YOLOv11 Classification
- MobileNetV3-Large

# Deep Learning Models Used
Six models were trained and evaluated:

- GoogLeNet Inception v1  
- GoogLeNet Inception v3  
- YOLOv8-Nano  
- YOLOv11 Classification  
- MobileNetV3-Small  
- MobileNetV3-Large  
Each model was trained on 29 plant disease classes with a 70/15/15 train–val–test split.
